PopEngine Web Platform
=====================
This is the web-platform of the PopEngine.

It has forked from https://github.com/NewChromantics/PopEngineCommon which is common code across all platforms, and cannot currently use ES6 modules.

As this is web-only, it is being converted to ES6 modules so the engine can be `import`ed properly.

Whilst PopEngine is not currently open source, the web-platform inevitably is.
