This will become a standalone PopEngine.js repos, since we now have native `import` support, `PopEngine.js` in https://github.com/NewChromantics/PopEngineCommon  is now a fully independent, single-es6-module-import engine, but needs to split away from `Common`(platform independent) js modules.

The code here is an out of date fork! (for now)
